# LRL APP - Centralized Portal with Laravel & Keycloak SSO

This project is a **centralized portal application** built with **Laravel 12**, designed to provide a seamless and secure entry point for both **end users** and **administrators**.

- üåê **Front Office (Users)**
    - Authentication via **Keycloak SSO (OIDC)**
    - Unified dashboard to access external applications (cloud storage, mailing tools, file sharing, etc.)
    - Role-based access control synced from Keycloak
- üõ† **Back Office (Admins)**
    - Authentication handled **locally in Laravel** (separate from Keycloak)
    - Built with **FilamentPHP** for a modern and intuitive admin panel
    - Advanced admin features: app configuration, user activity logs, monitoring
- üîí **Security & API**
    - JWT validation for user-facing APIs (via Keycloak)
    - Laravel Sanctum / API tokens for admin endpoints
    - Support for MFA, Single Logout, and audit logging
- ‚ö° **Tech Stack Highlights**
    - Laravel 12 (PHP 8.3)
    - Blade + Livewire (front office UI)
    - RestFul API (Dolibarr Bridge)
    - FilamentPHP (admin panel)
    - Redis (cache, sessions, queues)
    - MySQL (PostgreSQL coming soon)
    - Docker-ready + CI/CD support (coming soon)

This architecture allows associations to **centralize authentication and app access** while keeping the **admin back office independent and highly secure**.
